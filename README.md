Crack HTTP authentication by brute-force

Types of authentication currently supported:
* Basic Auth
* Digest Auth


# Requirements
Works on every OS. </br>
Regarding 3rd party libraries, only `requests` is required and could be installed by running the following command from the project's directory:
> pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Usage
The basic usage where one username is tested against a list of passwords is very straightforward
```bash
./httpbrute <taret_url> -u <username> -P <path_to_passlist>
```

### Notes
* Brute-forcing multiple users is possible by passing `-U <path_to_userlist>` instead of `-u <username>`
* It is possible to test a single password by passing `-p <password>` instead of `-P <path_to_passlist>`</br>
(useful for cases where only the username is known)
### Optional params
| param | description | default |
|---|---|---|
| -s, --sleep | sleep between requests (each worker individually) | 0[s] |
| -t, --timeout | request timeout in seconds | 10[s] |
| -w. --workers | amount of workers (running threads) | 16 |
